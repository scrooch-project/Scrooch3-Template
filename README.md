# 🎨 Scrooch 3 Modding Template

Welcome to your **Scrooch 3 Modding Template!**
This project makes it super easy to create your own custom Scratch 3 mod — tweak visuals, logic, styles, and more — all using **GitHub Pages** and your browser.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Fork this repo** 👉 [Click Here to Fork](https://github.com/Noahscratch493/Scrooch3-Template/fork)
2. In your fork, go to **Settings > Pages**, and set the source to the `main` branch and the `/ (root)` folder.
3. GitHub will give you a URL like:
   `https://your-username.github.io/your-mod-name`
   (This will use **whatever name you gave it** when forking!)

Now you're running your own Scratch 3 mod right from the browser! 🎉

## 🖼️ Editing Images (Beginner-Friendly)

If you're new to modding, start by customizing images!

Look inside:

* `/images/`
* `/static/`

You can change:

* The Scratch logo (`scratch-logo.svg`)
* Category icons or button images
* Backgrounds and other UI art

🧰 Tools to use:

* [Photopea](https://www.photopea.com/) (works in browser)
* Paint.NET or GIMP

📝 Keep image sizes and names the same unless you know how to adjust layout.

---

## 💻 JavaScript Modding (Advanced)

If you want to change how Scratch behaves, explore the JavaScript!

* `blocks/` and `extensions/`: Add or modify block behavior
* `gui/`: Change layout and UI logic
* `scratch-blocks/`: Deep block rendering logic

🔍 You can also open DevTools (F12) in your browser to test code on the fly.

---

## 🎨 CSS Styling (Advanced)

You can fully restyle the Scratch interface:

* Look for `.css` or `.scss` files in `gui/`
* Customize fonts, colors, borders, and spacing
* Use browser DevTools to preview changes instantly

Try making your own custom theme — like neon, retro, or minimalistic!

---

## 🧱 HTML Tweaks (Advanced)

Even though Scrooch 3 runs on React, the main `index.html` file is editable.

Use it to:

* Change the page title
* Add a custom favicon
* Load Google Fonts or extra scripts

---

## 💡 Extra Tips

* Keep testing in the browser as you make changes
* Save backups before doing big edits
* Try creating a themed mod like **Scratch Green**, **Scratch Retro**, or **Scratch Mobile-Lite**
